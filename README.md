## Deep Learning For Fun
<br>
This is the final project for the Deep Learning class at [USF MSDS program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science). 
Our goal is to train different Neural Network algorithms to identify funny reviews on Yelp.

<br>

### Algorithms 

We implemented the following algorithms using PyTorch:
	* LSTM
	* GRU
	* CNN
	* CNN with pretrained embeddings
    * LSTM +CNN
    * GRU + CNN
	* Sequential LSTM-CNN
	* Sequential CNN-LSTM
	* Character based GRU
