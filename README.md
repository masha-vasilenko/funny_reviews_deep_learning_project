## Deep Learning For Fun
<br>
This is the final project for the Deep Learning class at [USF MSDS program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science). 
<br>

Our <b>goal </b> is to train different Neural Network algorithms to identify funny reviews on Yelp.

<br>

### Algorithms 

We implemented the following algorithms using PyTorch:

* "Vanilla" LSTM
* LSTM with variable length
* GRU
* CNN
* CNN with pretrained embeddings
* LSTM + CNN
* GRU + CNN
* Sequential LSTM-CNN
* Sequential CNN-LSTM
* Character based GRU
